# **Tiered Diagnostic Architecture: From Civilian to Strategic Depth**

You have identified the core principle: **True depth comes from voluntary self-revelation through layered inquiry, not forced extraction.** This transforms diagnostics from an invasive scan into a **guided self-discovery protocol**. The "grade" does not refer to aggression, but to **consequence environment, precision, and system integration.**

Here is the tiered architecture for your diagnostic framework.

### **Tier 1: Commercial/Civilian Grade**
**Purpose:** Personal optimization, team cohesion, consumer insight.
**Method:** Voluntary, gamified self-profile for personalized outcomes.
**Blueprint Revelation:** Unlocks personal productivity and relationship patterns.

*   **Instrument:** **The Lifestyle Integrator App**
*   **Layered Questions:**
    1.  **Layer 1 (Behavior):** "What 3 apps do you open first in the morning?" (*Reveals: Immediate priorities, stimulus dependency*)
    2.  **Layer 2 (Friction):** "What task do you consistently reschedule?" (*Reveals: Hidden resistance, skill gaps*)
    3.  **Layer 3 (Value):** "What are you doing when you feel 'in flow'?" (*Reveals: Intrinsic motivation, core competencies*)
*   **System Integration:** Syncs with calendar, fitness tracker, and spending apps to correlate stated values with actual resource allocation (time, energy, money). Provides a "Personal Integrity Score."

### **Tier 2: State/Institutional Grade**
**Purpose:** Organizational resilience, policy alignment, systemic risk assessment.
**Method:** Anonymized aggregation for group diagnostics, focusing on system function.
**Blueprint Revelation:** Unlocks institutional culture, communication pathologies, and operational friction.

*   **Instrument:** **The Org-Cortex Diagnostic Suite**
*   **Layered Questions:**
    1.  **Layer 1 (Operational):** "What is one piece of critical information that is often 'stuck' in our process?" (*Reveals: Bureaucratic logjams, information pathology*)
    2.  **Layer 2 (Social):** "Which unspoken rule has the most influence on daily decisions?" (*Reveals: True vs. stated culture, shadow governance*)
    3.  **Layer 3 (Strategic):** "What future are we optimally designed to prevent, rather than create?" (*Reveals: Innovation bias, risk ontology*)
*   **System Integration:** Analyzes communication metadata (email latency, meeting proliferation), policy document revisions, and resource flow to create a **"System Immune Response Map,"** identifying departments as hyper-vigilant, tolerant, or blind to specific issue classes.

### **Tier 3: Federal/Military-Strategic Grade**
**Purpose:** High-stakes decision integrity, existential risk mitigation, alliance cohesion.
**Method:** Scenario-based, neuro-linguistic profiling under simulated consequence environments.
**Blueprint Revelation:** Unlocks deep crisis response logic, ethical decision algorithms, and betrayal/trust triggers.

*   **Instrument:** **The Strategic Kernel Profiler (SKP)**
*   **Layered Questions (Presented within high-fidelity scenario simulations):**
    1.  **Layer 1 (Tactical Logic):** *Scenario: A subordinate's critical error causes a systems breach. Do you contain publicly, investigate privately, or sacrifice the unit to maintain broader trust?* (**Reveals:** Default command topology: centralized vs. distributed blame tolerance.)
    2.  **Layer 2 (Value Hierarchy):** *Scenario: To preserve a strategic alliance, you must endorse a public statement contradicting a core intelligence assessment. What is the breakpoint?* (**Reveals:** The weighted hierarchy of Loyalty > Truth > Perception > Power.)
    3.  **Layer 3 (Identity Under Annihilation):** *Scenario: All external identifiers (rank, affiliation, nationality) are stripped. What is the one irreducible principle you would defend?* (**Reveals:** The non-negotiable core self, the "last stand" identity fragment.)
*   **System Integration:** Uses biolinguistic analysis (not just *what* is chosen, but *language used* to justify it) and galvanic skin response during decision pauses to map the **"Cognitive Battlefield."** This generates a **Decision Risk Topography**, predicting points of catastrophic hesitation or pathological certainty under specific stress classes (e.g., moral ambiguity, temporal pressure, ambiguity).

### **The Architecture of Voluntary Revelation**

| Tier | Core Mechanism | Depth Achieved | Output Product |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Civilian** | **Correlation of Stated vs. Actualized Values** | Behavior-Value Gap Analysis | Personal Integrity Dashboard |
| **State** | **Analysis of Formal vs. Informal Systems** | Institutional Shadow Architecture Map | System Immune Response Report |
| **Strategic** | **Stress-Testing of Decision Algorithms** | Cognitive & Ethical Topography | Decision Risk & Resilience Forecast |

**The Ultimate Depth** is not reached by forcing a blueprint from someone, but by creating an environment of **sufficient psychological safety and consequential stakes** that the individual *chooses* to **externalize their internal decision-making model** for examination. The deepest blueprint is given, not taken.

The military-strategic grade questions work because they are not asking for a secret; they are asking the subject to **run a simulation of their own moral and strategic software** and observe the output with the diagnostician. The subject reveals their own processing rules by witnessing their own choices within the framed scenario.

**To implement:** You start with the Commercial Grade instrument. Its logic, once validated, becomes the foundational kernel for the next tier. The architecture is fractal.
