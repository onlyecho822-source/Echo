# Echo Universe Project Board

This document tracks major ongoing projects and initiatives, particularly those related to addressing architectural and philosophical gaps identified in formal audits.

## Project: "Closing the Five Gaps" (RED_TEAM_AUDIT_DEC2025)

**Objective:** Address the five critical gaps identified in the December 2025 Red Team audit to move the Echo Universe from a theoretical framework to a professionally legitimate and resilient system.

| Gap | Project | Status | Owner | Target Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GAP 1: Conceptual Paradox** | `project/epistemic-acknowledgement` |  scoping | @onlyecho822-source | Q1 2026 |
| **GAP 2: Baseline Establishment** | `project/comparative-diagnostics` | backlog | @onlyecho822-source | Q2 2026 |
| **GAP 3: Ledger Immutability** | `project/merkle-tree-ledger` | in-progress | @manus-ai | Q1 2026 |
| **GAP 4: Peer Review Mechanism** | `project/echo-share-protocol` | scoping | @onlyecho822-source | Q2 2026 |
| **GAP 5: Professional Legitimacy** | `project/open-research-program` | in-progress | @onlyecho822-source | Q1 2026 |

### GAP 1: Conceptual Paradox: The Observer Effect
- **Problem:** The act of observing and naming a "pre-legible" organ makes it legible, destroying the very thing we claim to observe.
- **Proposed Solution:** Explicitly acknowledge this in all documentation. Frame Echo Universe as an accelerator of legibility, not a passive observer of a fixed reality.
- **Tracking Issue:** #12

### GAP 2: Baseline Establishment Problem
- **Problem:** The 90-day observation period for establishing a "healthy" baseline is flawed. We might be normalizing pathology.
- **Proposed Solution:** Develop a "Comparative Diagnostic Framework" by observing 100+ diverse projects to create population-level norms for system health.
- **Tracking Issue:** #13

### GAP 3: Ledger Immutability
- **Problem:** The governance ledger is a mutable JSON file. It can be forged.
- **Proposed Solution:** Re-architect the ledger as a proper Merkle tree, where each entry is cryptographically chained to the previous one. This makes tampering detectable.
- **Tracking Issue:** #14

### GAP 4: No Peer Review or Second Opinion Mechanism
- **Problem:** A lone "Internet Clinician" without peer oversight is dangerous and lacks professional legitimacy.
- **Proposed Solution:** Create an `echo-share.ps1` script to export redacted, encrypted diagnostic reports for secure sharing and peer review.
- **Tracking Issue:** #15

### GAP 5: The "Shadow Professional" Problem
- **Problem:** We are proposing a new profession without the institutional infrastructure (licensing, ethics boards, insurance) that makes professions legitimate.
- **Proposed Solution:** Reframe the project as an "Open Research Program into Software System Diagnostics." We are researchers, not clinicians (for now). This manages expectations and reduces liability.
- **Tracking Issue:** #16
