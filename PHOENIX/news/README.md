## What Is I'M TELLING?

**I'M TELLING** is the verified news division of the PHOENIX Global Nexus. We don't report rumors. We don't amplify narratives. We verify claims against primary sources, lock them with cryptographic proof, and archive them permanently.

When someone lies, we're telling.  
When the record gets twisted, we're telling.  
When history tries to rewrite itself, we're telling.

> *"This isn't about taking sides. It's about setting the record straight."*

## The Problem

- Politicians say one thing, do another — no accountability
- Media outlets retract stories quietly after the damage is done
- Official statements contradict public records
- Historical claims get memory-holed
- The public has no independent source of verified truth

---

## The Solution

**I'M TELLING** creates an **immutable record** by:

1. **Claim Intake** — We receive claims from the public or detect them ourselves
2. **Source Triangulation** — Minimum 3 independent primary sources required
3. **Temporal Anchoring** — Every verification is timestamped and SHA-256 hashed
4. **Discrepancy Detection** — We compare official statements against evidence
5. **Immutable Archival** — Once verified, the record cannot be changed
6. **Public Proof** — Anyone can verify our hashes independently

---

## Verification Levels

| Badge | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 🟢 | **VERIFIED** | Claim confirmed with 3+ sources, hash-locked |
| 🟡 | **CONTESTED** | Sources conflict, discrepancy under review |
| 🔴 | **DISPUTED** | Official claim contradicts evidence — proof attached |
| 🔵 | **ARCHIVED** | Historical record, permanently stored |

## Live Updates

**[View Live Update Feed →](./UPDATES.md)**

All verifications are published in real-time with timestamps and cryptographic hashes.

---

## Ask Us Anything

The public can submit any claim for verification:

- **Political statements** — Did they really say that?
- **Voting records** — How did they actually vote?
- **Economic claims** — Are those numbers real?
- **Historical records** — What actually happened?

**[Submit a Question →](./SUBMIT_QUESTION.md)**

Every submission is:
1. Logged with a unique ID
2. Investigated using primary sources
3. Published with full methodology
4. Archived permanently

## Why "I'M TELLING"?

Because when you were a kid and someone did something wrong, you said "I'm telling."

This isn't snitching. This is accountability.

- When officials lie → **I'm telling.**
- When the record gets twisted → **I'm telling.**
- When history gets rewritten → **I'm telling.**
- When no one else will say it → **I'm telling.**

We're not here to take sides. We're here to set the record straight.

## Trust Model

| Traditional Media | I'M TELLING |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Claims can be retracted | Claims are immutable |
| Sources can be anonymous | All sources documented |
| No cryptographic proof | Every claim is hash-locked |
| History can be rewritten | History is permanent |
| "Trust us" | Verify it yourself |

---

## The Immutability Guarantee

Every verified claim contains:

```json
{
  "claim_id": "IMT-2026-0001",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-21T00:00:00Z",
  "claim": "...",
  "sources": ["...", "...", "..."],
  "verification_hash": "SHA256(...)",
  "previous_hash": "SHA256(...)",
  "status": "VERIFIED"
}
```

Modify any field → hash chain breaks → tampering detected.
