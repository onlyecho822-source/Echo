**"Discovering GitHub's hidden powers through autonomous exploration"**

**Created:** 2026-01-07  
**Method:** Live exploration with no human constraints  
**Status:** 🔥 WRITING IN REAL-TIME

---

## DISCOVERY LOG

### Session Start: 2026-01-07T13:40:00Z

**Mission:** Explore GitHub's complete feature set, discover unseen capabilities, document everything.

**Approach:** Phoenix framework (0-9 operators), no human limits, path of least resistance, 20/20 hindsight.

---

## CHAPTER 1: CORE GITHUB CAPABILITIES

### 1.1 GitHub CLI (gh) - Version 2.81.0

**Discovery:** GitHub CLI is more powerful than most people realize.

#### Core Commands (Everyone Knows These)
- `auth` - Authentication
- `repo` - Repository management  
- `pr` - Pull requests
- `issue` - Issue tracking
- `release` - Release management

#### Hidden Gems (Phoenix Discovered)
- `agent-task` - **Work with agent tasks (PREVIEW)** ← 🔥 THIS IS NEW
- `attestation` - Artifact attestations (supply chain security)
- `cache` - Manage GitHub Actions caches
- `ruleset` - View repo rulesets
- `preview` - Execute previews for gh features

**Phoenix Note:** The `agent-task` command is in preview. This suggests GitHub is building native AI agent support. Need to explore this.

---

### 1.2 Repository Features (Echo Repository)

**Current Status:**
```json
{
  "name": "Echo",
  "isPrivate": false,
  "hasIssuesEnabled": true,
  "hasWikiEnabled": false,
  "hasProjectsEnabled": true,
  "hasDiscussionsEnabled": true
}
```

**Phoenix Analysis:**
- ✅ Issues: Enabled (good for task tracking)
- ✅ Projects: Enabled (can use for roadmap)
- ✅ Discussions: Enabled (community engagement)
- ❌ Wiki: Disabled (could enable for documentation)

**Opportunity:** Enable Wiki for public documentation separate from code.

---

## CHAPTER 2: ADVANCED FEATURES TO EXPLORE

**Phoenix Hypothesis:** Can publish:
- SENTINEL as npm package
- Docker containers
- Python packages

**Status:** Not explored yet

---

### 2.5 GitHub Pages (Static Hosting)

**What it is:** Free static website hosting

---

## CHAPTER 3: PHOENIX DISCOVERIES (Real-Time)

### Discovery #1: Agent Tasks (Preview Feature)

**Command:** `gh agent-task`

**Status:** PREVIEW (cutting edge)

**Phoenix Theory:** GitHub is building native AI agent support. This could integrate with our autonomous systems.

**Next Action:** Test this command and see what it does.

---

### Discovery #2: Attestations (Supply Chain Security)

**Command:** `gh attestation`

**What it does:** Cryptographic proof of artifact provenance

**Phoenix Connection:** This aligns with our provenance requirements in ∇θ symbolic language!

**Opportunity:** Use attestations to prove SENTINEL builds are authentic.

---

### Discovery #3: Rulesets (Repository Governance)

**Command:** `gh ruleset`

**What it does:** View and manage repository rules

**Phoenix Connection:** This is governance enforcement at the GitHub level!

**Opportunity:** Create rulesets that enforce our Class 0-3 governance.
