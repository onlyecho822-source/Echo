**Subject:** Story Pitch: The $70 Billion Americans Don't Know They Have

**Body:**
Dear [Reporter Name],

I'm reaching out with a story idea that combines investigative journalism, consumer advocacy, and human interest.

**The Story:**
Americans are owed $70+ billion in unclaimed property - bank accounts, insurance policies, tax refunds - but most don't know it exists. State governments hold this money but struggle to return it to rightful owners.

**The Angle:**
- Why is so much money unclaimed?
- How do states handle (or mishandle) returns?
- Who's most affected? (Often underserved communities)
- What's being done to fix it?

**What We Offer:**
- Exclusive data analysis by state
- Success story interviews
- Expert commentary
- Visualization tools

Interested in exploring this further?

Best regards,
EchoNate
