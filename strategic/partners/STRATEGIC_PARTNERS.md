## XI. PARTNER PITCH TEMPLATES

### Government Partners
**Subject:** AI-Powered Outreach for Unclaimed Property Returns

**Body:**
Dear [Treasurer Name],

I'm reaching out regarding an opportunity to significantly increase unclaimed property return rates, particularly in underserved communities.

We've developed an AI-powered system that:
- Automates owner identification and outreach
- Focuses on high-value properties (>$1,000)
- Prioritizes underserved zip codes
- Reduces administrative burden on your office

Inspired by Cook County's successful "Black Houses Matter" initiative, we believe this technology can help return more property to rightful owners while reducing costs.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss a pilot program?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
