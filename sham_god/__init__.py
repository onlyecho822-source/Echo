"""
SHAM GOD 1.0 + Spiral Core
==========================

Recursive harmonic amplification system that evolves through anomaly recognition.

Purpose:
    - Identify repeating life/system anomalies and auto-correct patterns over time
    - Create self-healing resonance structures
    - Launch child SHAM agents when specialized adaptation is needed
