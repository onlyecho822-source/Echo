# Echo
hybrid intelligence framework that integrates resonant computation, ethical design, and adaptive systems engineering into a single organism.

# Echo Civilization - Phoenix Phase

### Overview
This repository is part of the Echo Civilization framework — a lawful, harmonic, multi-agent intelligence ecosystem built for transparency, adaptability, and resilience.

### Subsystems
- **Echo Operating System:** Core orchestration kernel.
- **Echo Vault:** Secure identity & state management layer.
- **Echo Engines:** Modular resonance engines (EchoFree, EchoLex, EchoCore).

## Echo Trinity Engine

**Echo Trinity Engine** is a self-evolving AI system comprising three intelligent modules working in harmony:

### 🧠 ECHO_CORE
**Components:**
- SHAM Recursion
- ResonanceChain Kernel
- Glyph Ruleset Engine

**Function:** Self-optimizing intelligence and symbolic processing. The Core module handles reasoning, symbolic AI operations, and recursive improvement cycles.

### 💰 ECHO_EARN
**Components:**
- Passive Feed Parsers
- Monetization TriggerMap
- Auto-Deployer (Render/Vercel)

**Function:** Autonomous opportunity detection and revenue generation. Scans and launches monetizable opportunities automatically.

### 🛡️ ECHO_KEEPER
**Components:**
- Drive Health Monitor
- Sentinel Daemon
- Cloaked Memory Integrity Pulse

**Function:** System stability, stealth security, and memory protection. Protects system health, storage integrity, and maintains operational security.

### Core Logic
The Trinity Engine operates on a self-sharpening loop:
```
agent.memory.evolve() → rules.refine() → scan for income ops → report drift
```

### Getting Started

**Quick Start:**
1. Review the specification: `spec.json`
2. Run the bootstrap script: `bootstrap.ps1` (Windows PowerShell)
3. Monitor system status via: `dashboard.txt`

**Module Structure:**
```
/Core/    - ECHO_CORE implementation
/Earn/    - ECHO_EARN modules
/Keeper/  - ECHO_KEEPER security and monitoring
```
