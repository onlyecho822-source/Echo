# Echo - Self-Evolving AI Architect

A hybrid intelligence framework that integrates resonant computation, ethical design, and adaptive systems engineering into a single organism.

## Overview

Echo is a **Recursive Problem-Solving Engine** + **Economic Opportunity Scanner** + **Self-Preservation Core** — an autonomous agent that:

- **Maintains system integrity** (hardware + software health check architecture)
- **Expands its own intelligence recursively** (code refinement, problem-solving heuristics)
- **Monitors markets and ecosystems for passive income streams** (opportunity detection)
- **Solves real-time problems for immediate or compounding monetary gain** (profit loop logic)

## Architecture

### Primary Agents

#### ECHO_CORE - Self-Upgrading Logic Engine
- Recursive problem decomposition
- Strategy optimization and refinement
- Model and prompt self-improvement
- Value leak detection and rebuild protocols

#### ECHO_EARN - Opportunity Scanner
- Market trend analysis
- Arbitrage detection
- Affiliate opportunity scanning
- Content gap analysis
- Service demand monitoring
- Passive asset deployment

#### ECHO_KEEPER - System Guardian
- Disk health monitoring
- Memory and CPU tracking
- File-state integrity watching
- OS log analysis
- Self-preservation protocols

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/onlyecho822-source/Echo.git
cd Echo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install as package
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Run the Echo Loop

```bash
# Start continuous operation
python main.py

# Run a single cycle
python main.py --single

# Show system status
python main.py --status

# Use custom configuration
python main.py --config config/custom.json

# Set custom interval (seconds)
python main.py --interval 60
```

### Echo Loop Cycle

```python
while True:
    ECHO_EARN.scan_opportunities()
    ECHO_CORE.evaluate()
    ECHO_KEEPER.run_health_check()
    if ECHO_CORE.detect_value_leak():
        ECHO_CORE.rebuild()
    if ECHO_EARN.finds_profit():
        ECHO_EARN.launch_moneymaker()
    time.sleep(300)  # Adaptive sleep cycle
```

## Validation & Falsification Plan

1. Can it run 24/7 without memory or logic drift?
2. Does it identify **real**, **achievable**, **measurable** opportunities?
3. Can it deploy new monetizable digital products/services autonomously?
4. Can it self-diagnose flaws and propose improvements?
5. Can it simulate risk vs reward and pivot behavior?

## Configuration

Edit `config/default.json` or create `config/local.json`:

```json
{
    "sleep_interval": 300,
    "adaptive_sleep": true,
    "core": {
        "drift_threshold": 0.15
    },
    "earn": {
        "risk_tolerance": 0.5,
        "min_roi": 0.1,
        "max_assets": 10
    },
    "keeper": {
        "disk_warning": 80,
        "disk_critical": 95
    }
}
```

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
