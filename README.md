# Echo

Hybrid intelligence framework that integrates resonant computation, ethical design, and adaptive systems engineering into a single organism.

## Echo Civilization - Phoenix Phase

### Overview
This repository is part of the Echo Civilization framework — a lawful, harmonic, multi-agent intelligence ecosystem built for transparency, adaptability, and resilience.

### Subsystems
- **Echo Operating System:** Core orchestration kernel.
- **Echo Vault:** Secure identity & state management layer.
- **Echo Engines:** Modular resonance engines (EchoFree, EchoLex, EchoCore).

## Aletheia Truth Verification Engine

**Aletheia** (Αλήθεια - Greek goddess of truth) is a comprehensive system for truth verification and narrative reconstruction through multi-domain evidence correlation.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Multi-Domain Evidence Analysis
- **Symbolic & Linguistic Decoder** - Ancient text analysis, symbol tracking across cultures, detection of meaning inversions
- **Material & Forensic Analyzer** - Material composition, dating, origin determination, pigment analysis
- **Genetic & Genealogical Tracker** - Population genetics, migration patterns, ancestry verification
- **Provenance Tracer** - Ownership history, theft detection, repatriation case building

#### 2. Correlation & Reasoning Engines
- **Correlation Engine (Panopticon)** - Cross-domain evidence correlation, pattern detection, discrepancy identification
- **Epistemic Reasoning Engine** - Source reliability, bias detection, evidence weighting, paradigm analysis
- **Ontological Mapper** - Cosmic questions, cross-cultural cosmology, ancient-modern concept correlation
- **Narrative Reconstructor** - Corrected narratives, erasure timelines, corrective dossiers

### Key Features

#### Truth Verification
- Multi-domain evidence correlation
- Source reliability assessment
- Bias detection and correction
- Confidence scoring

#### Narrative Correction
- Challenge official narratives with evidence
- Generate corrective dossiers
- Support repatriation claims
- Identify suppression mechanisms

#### Cosmic Questions
- Cross-cultural cosmology comparison
- Ancient wisdom / modern physics correlation
- Question reframing and deepening
- Investigation path generation

### Usage

```python
from aletheia import Aletheia
from aletheia.core.models import Artifact, Evidence, Narrative, GeoLocation

# Initialize the engine
aletheia = Aletheia()

# Investigate an artifact
result = aletheia.investigate_artifact(artifact, evidence)

# Generate corrective dossier
dossier = aletheia.generate_corrective_dossier(artifact, narrative, evidence)

# Analyze cosmic question
cosmic = aletheia.analyze_cosmic_question("What is consciousness?")

# Compare cosmologies
comparison = aletheia.compare_cosmologies("Hindu", "Aboriginal")
```

### Run Demonstration

```bash
python -m aletheia.demo
```

This runs comprehensive demonstrations of:
1. Artifact investigation (Benin Bronze case study)
2. Narrative correction (Mathematical knowledge attribution)
3. Cosmic question analysis
4. Cosmology comparison
5. Genetic evidence analysis
6. Ancient text decoding

### Philosophy

Aletheia is designed to:

1. **Break the Monopoly on Narrative** - Challenge institutional control of historical truth
2. **Restore Suppressed Knowledge** - Recover what has been stolen, hidden, or erased
3. **Support Repatriation** - Build evidence-based cases for returning cultural heritage
4. **Ask Better Questions** - Reframe cosmic questions based on cross-cultural wisdom

### Core Principles

- **Multi-Domain Evidence** - No single evidence type is definitive; truth emerges from convergence
- **Source Criticism** - All sources have biases; adjust confidence accordingly
- **Paradigm Awareness** - Our frameworks shape what we can see as true
- **Falsifiability** - Actively seek to disprove assertions
- **Indigenous Inclusion** - Oral traditions and non-Western sources are valid evidence

### Data Models

- `Evidence` - A piece of evidence with type, source, reliability, and confidence
- `Artifact` - A physical object with provenance, materials, and cultural context
- `Narrative` - A historical story with truth score and bias analysis
- `CorrectiveDossier` - Complete output for narrative correction
- `TruthAssertion` - A claim with evidence and confidence scoring
- `CosmicQuery` - Analysis of metaphysical/cosmic questions

### Future Development

- Integration with museum databases
- Machine learning for symbol recognition
- Automated evidence gathering
- Interactive visualization
- API for external systems
