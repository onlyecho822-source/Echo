# Echo
hybrid intelligence framework that integrates resonant computation, ethical design, and adaptive systems engineering into a single organism.
# Echo Civilization - Phoenix Phase

### Overview
This repository is part of the Echo Civilization framework — a lawful, harmonic, multi-agent intelligence ecosystem built for transparency, adaptability, and resilience.

### Subsystems
- **Echo Operating System:** Core orchestration kernel.
- **Echo Vault:** Secure identity & state management layer.
- **Echo Engines:** Modular resonance engines (EchoFree, EchoLex, EchoCore).
- **Echo Forge:** Meta-AI builder that creates other AI applications autonomously.

### Echo Forge - Meta-AI Builder

Echo Forge is an autonomous AI system that builds other AI applications. It automates the entire development lifecycle from idea generation to deployment.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Create a chatbot
python echo_forge.py

# Run examples
python examples/quick_start.py 1

# Deploy an app
python deployment_manager.py deploy <app_name>
```

**Features:**
- 🤖 Generates 8+ types of AI applications (chatbots, analyzers, agents, etc.)
- 🏗️ Supports multiple tech stacks (Python, Node.js, FastAPI)
- 📦 Production-ready code with Docker support
- 🔄 Recursive AI - can create AIs that create other AIs
- 🚀 One-command deployment
