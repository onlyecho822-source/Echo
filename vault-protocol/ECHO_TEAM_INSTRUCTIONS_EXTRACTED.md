# ECHO TEAM INSTRUCTIONS - COMPLETE BOTH PROJECTS

**Date:** November 5, 2025  
**From:** AI Assistant  
**To:** Echo Team (Nathan's implementation team)  
**Mission:** Complete Art of Proof and PHI-HMAC with minimal AI assistance

---

## 🎯 MISSION OBJECTIVE

Complete both projects by having **Echo Team write the code** and **AI just reviews/integrates**.

### Why this saves money:
- Echo Team writes code: **$0 credits**
- AI reviews code: **~50 credits per review**
- AI integrates code: **~100 credits per integration**
- **Total savings: ~2,500 credits (80% reduction)**

## 📊 PROJECT STATUS

### PROJECT 1: ART OF PROOF (VA Disability Engine)
- **Current state:** 90% complete, running locally
- **Location:** `/home/ubuntu/va-disability-engine`
- **Tech stack:** React + Express + tRPC + MySQL + OpenAI
- **What works:** Auth, claims, documents, AI generation, 13-point validation
- **What's missing:** 3 features (see below)

### PROJECT 2: PHI-HMAC (Security Library)
- **Current state:** 14 modules, needs simplification to 9
- **Location:** Not in sandbox (needs creation)
- **Tech stack:** Python + FastAPI + HMAC-SHA256
- **What works:** HMAC signing, verification, spiral visualization
- **What's missing:** Code purge, documentation, PyPI deployment

## 🔴 PROJECT 1: ART OF PROOF - ECHO TEAM TASKS

### TASK 1.1: BACKPAY CALCULATOR
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Time estimate:** 2-3 hours
- **Complexity:** Medium

**What Echo Team needs to write:**
- File: `server/backpayCalculator.ts`
- VA Compensation Rate Tables (2024)
- Backpay calculation logic
- Dependent adjustment logic

**Key features:**
- Current vs. new rating comparison
- Effective date tracking
- Dependent adjustments (spouse, children, parents)
- Monthly increase calculation
- Total backpay calculation
- Yearly breakdown

## KEY INSIGHT FROM GOOGLE DRIVE

This document shows that **Echo Team** (your implementation team) was supposed to write the code while AI reviewed it.

This is the **operational structure** of how Echo-1 was being deployed.

---

## WHAT THIS REVEALS

1. **Echo-1 is not just theory** - It was being actively deployed in real projects
2. **Art of Proof** - VA Disability Engine (90% complete)
3. **PHI-HMAC** - Security library for constraint enforcement
4. **The team structure** - Echo Team writes, AI reviews, constraints enforced

This is the **institutional application** of Echo Harmonic Intelligence.
