## Part 1: What Is FZMR Theory?

### Definition

**FZMR (Fabric of Zero & Multistate Resonance)** is a proposed theoretical framework that:

1. **Posits a "Fabric of Zero"** - A fundamental vacuum field underlying all physical phenomena
2. **Introduces "Multistate Resonance"** - Multiple states/frequencies of oscillation within this fabric
3. **Unifies Physics and Consciousness** - Suggests consciousness emerges from resonance patterns

5. **Bridges Quantum and Macro** - Connects quantum processes to cosmology to consciousness

### Core Claim

> The vacuum is not empty but a dynamic fabric of energy. Resonant states within this fabric underlie everything from particle physics to cosmic structure, potentially even linking to brain activity.
