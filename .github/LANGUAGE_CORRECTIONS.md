# LANGUAGE CORRECTIONS — Devil Mandate 3

**Purpose:** Kill mythology. Use honest terms.

## FORBIDDEN → REQUIRED

| ❌ Forbidden Term | ✅ Required Term | Reason |
|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| Autonomous | Scheduled automation | No decisions made without trigger |
| Intelligence | Data correlation | Pattern matching, not cognition |
| Agent | Scheduled script | Cron job, not autonomous entity |
| AI-powered | Algorithm-based | No learning, just rules |
| Production-ready | Development prototype | No SLO, no load testing |
| Alpha generation | Signal hypothesis | Unvalidated predictions |
| Value: $850K | Value: Unvalidated | Zero customers, zero revenue |
| Phoenix Global Nexus | Echo Signal Detector | Collapsed scope |
| Bounded Autonomous Intelligence | Guardrailed automation | Honest description |
| Agent swarm | Scheduled scripts | Multiple cron jobs |
| Real-time | Near-real-time (15-60 min) | Actual update frequency |
| Cross-domain intelligence | Multi-source correlation | Honest description |

## MARKETING → ENGINEERING

| ❌ Marketing | ✅ Engineering |
|--------------|----------------|
| Revolutionary | Novel approach |
| Game-changing | Potentially useful |
| Unprecedented | First attempt |
| Best-in-class | Competitive |
| World-class | Professional quality |
| Cutting-edge | Current technology |
| Seamless | Low-friction |
| Powerful | Capable |
| Robust | Tested |
| Scalable | Designed for growth |

## UNBOUNDED → BOUNDED

| ❌ Unbounded | ✅ Bounded |
|--------------|-----------|
| Always works | Works in tested conditions |
| Never fails | Fails gracefully |
| Perfect accuracy | 88.5% success rate |
| Guaranteed results | Expected outcomes |
| 100% reliable | 65% workflow success |
| Infinite scale | Designed for X load |

## EXAMPLES

### Before (Mythology)
> "Phoenix Global Nexus is an autonomous intelligence system that provides real-time alpha generation through AI-powered cross-domain analysis."

### After (Truth)
> "Echo Signal Detector is a scheduled automation tool that correlates data from multiple public APIs to generate signal hypotheses for manual validation."

---

### Before (Mythology)
> "Our agent swarm operates 24/7, providing unprecedented market intelligence with guaranteed accuracy."

### After (Truth)
> "Our scheduled scripts run hourly via GitHub Actions, collecting public data with 88.5% API success rate. Signal accuracy is unvalidated."

## ENFORCEMENT

All documentation, code comments, and communications must:

1. **Avoid forbidden terms** — Use required alternatives
2. **Include metrics** — Every claim needs a number
3. **State confidence** — Verified / Supported / Hypothesis
4. **Acknowledge limits** — What doesn't work

---

## REVIEW CHECKLIST

Before publishing any claim:

- [ ] Does it use honest language?
- [ ] Does it include a metric?
- [ ] Does it state confidence level?
- [ ] Does it acknowledge limitations?
- [ ] Would it embarrass you if proven false?

If any answer is "no", revise before publishing.
