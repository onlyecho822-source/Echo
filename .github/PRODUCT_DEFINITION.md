# ECHO SIGNAL DETECTOR — Product Definition

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Development Prototype  
**Date:** January 21, 2026

---

## ONE SENTENCE

> Echo Signal Detector correlates alternative data sources with market movements to generate testable trading hypotheses.

---

## WHAT IT IS

A **data correlation tool** that:
1. Collects data from free public APIs
2. Detects patterns across domains
3. Generates signal hypotheses
4. Outputs structured alerts

---

## WHAT IT IS NOT

- ❌ Not autonomous (scheduled automation)
- ❌ Not intelligent (pattern matching)
- ❌ Not a trading system (no execution)
- ❌ Not production-ready (development prototype)
- ❌ Not validated (hypotheses only)

---

## CORE FUNCTION

```
INPUT:  Alternative data (seismic, health, sentiment, climate)
PROCESS: Cross-domain correlation detection
OUTPUT: Signal hypothesis with confidence score
```

## SIGNAL HYPOTHESES (Unvalidated)

### Hypothesis 1: SEISMIC → TRV
- **Claim:** M6+ earthquakes correlate with TRV underperformance
- **Mechanism:** Insurance claims uncertainty
- **Backtest Edge:** -0.12% (30-day window)
- **Confidence:** 0.65 (Hypothesis)
- **Status:** Requires 6-month validation

### Hypothesis 2: HEALTH → PFE
- **Claim:** COVID critical cases correlate with PFE demand
- **Mechanism:** Pharmaceutical demand signal
- **Backtest Edge:** TBD
- **Confidence:** 0.55 (Hypothesis)
- **Status:** Insufficient data

### Hypothesis 3: WSB_SENTIMENT → VIX
- **Claim:** Extreme WSB sentiment precedes volatility
- **Mechanism:** Retail positioning indicator
- **Current Reading:** 4.37 (extreme bullish)
- **Confidence:** 0.60 (Hypothesis)
- **Status:** Requires validation

## ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Validation (Current)
- [ ] Paper trade signals for 30 days
- [ ] Track predictions vs. outcomes
- [ ] Calculate actual hit rate

### Phase 2: Infrastructure
- [ ] Alpaca paper trading integration
- [ ] Position sizing implementation
- [ ] Risk management layer

### Phase 3: Measurement
- [ ] Daily P&L tracking
- [ ] Signal attribution
- [ ] Performance dashboard

### Phase 4: Decision
- [ ] If positive edge: Scale
- [ ] If no edge: Pivot or kill

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The product succeeds if:
1. **Hit rate > 55%** on signal predictions
2. **Sharpe ratio > 0.5** on paper trades
3. **Positive P&L** over 90-day period

If these criteria are not met after 90 days, the product hypothesis is invalidated.
