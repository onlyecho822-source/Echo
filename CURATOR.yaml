    ## 🌟 Emergent Patterns & Discoveries
    
    **Pattern 1: Pivot from Constraint to Opportunity**
    - Started: Illinois unclaimed property (bot-protected)
    - Discovered: Federal benefits ($140B, no barriers)
    - Result: 2x larger market, recurring revenue, aligned incentives
    - **Significance:** Critical strategic pivot
    
    **Pattern 2: Technology + Human Hybrid**
    - Automation alone fails (bot protection)
    - Humans alone don't scale
    - Combination succeeds (Link Health model)
    - **Significance:** Fundamental architecture insight
    
    **Pattern 3: Eight Unseen Pathways**
    - Healthcare (proven)
    - Employers, banks, utilities, schools, justice, disaster, immigration, religious
    - **Significance:** 8x market expansion potential
