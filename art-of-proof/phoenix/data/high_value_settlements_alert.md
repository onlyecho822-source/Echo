## Key Observations

### Settlement Patterns

**Data Breach Dominance:** 15 out of 16 high-value settlements (93.75%) are related to data breaches, reflecting the ongoing cybersecurity crisis affecting healthcare, financial services, and other sectors handling sensitive personal information.

**Healthcare Sector Concentration:** A significant portion of high-value settlements involve healthcare organizations (City of Hope, Oklahoma Spine Hospital, Behavioral Health Resources, Dakota Eye Institute, Planned Parenthood of Montana, Therapeutic Health Services, Alabama Cardiovascular Group), indicating heightened vulnerability in the medical sector.

**Geographic Considerations:** Several settlements offer enhanced payments for California residents, reflecting stronger consumer protection laws in that state.

### Payout Structure

**Tiered Payment Systems:** Most settlements offer a two-tier structure:
- **Base Payment:** $100-$150 for class members without documented losses
- **Enhanced Payment:** Up to $5,000-$10,000 for documented losses or extraordinary claims

**No Proof Required:** The majority of settlements (87.5%) do not require proof of purchase or documentation for the base payment tier, lowering barriers to participation.

### Timing Analysis

**Urgent Action Window:** 13 of the 16 high-value settlements have deadlines within the next 7 days, requiring immediate action for potential claimants.

**Recent Breaches:** Most data breaches occurred in 2023-2024, with settlements reaching resolution within 1-2 years of the incident.
