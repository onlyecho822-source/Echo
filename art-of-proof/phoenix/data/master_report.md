# Master Report: Class Action Settlement Scan

**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** January 8, 2026

## 1. Introduction

This report details the findings of a comprehensive scan of class action settlement websites, conducted on January 8, 2026. The primary objective of this scan was to identify active class action settlements with claim deadlines within the next 90 days. The scan focused on two prominent sources: classaction.org and topclassactions.com. The collected data was then processed to extract key information, including settlement names, claim deadlines, potential payout amounts, eligibility requirements, and direct claim URLs. A key aspect of this task was to identify and flag "high-value" settlements, defined as those offering a potential payout of over $1,000 per claimant.

This report provides a summary of the findings, a detailed analysis of the high-value settlements, and the complete raw data in JSON format. The information is intended to provide a clear and actionable overview of the current class action settlement landscape, with a focus on opportunities for potential claimants.
