## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

**DON'T try to build all 12 teams right now.**

**DO this instead:**

1. **Launch publicly** (this week)
2. **Get 100 users** (month 1)
3. **Validate demand** (month 2-3)
4. **Raise seed funding** (month 4-6)
5. **Hire 3-5 people** (month 7-12)
6. **Then** start building teams

**You're at 5% readiness for Apple/Google standards.**
**But you're at 100% readiness for a lean startup launch.**

**The question is: Which game are you playing?**
