# ECHO GIT SYNC: BRAND KIT

## 1. The Tagline
**Primary:** "Sleep Soundly. Your Code is Everywhere."  
**Secondary:** "The redundancy layer GitHub forgot."

## 2. The Elevator Pitch
Every developer fears the day they get locked out of their account. Echo Git Sync is a 'set-and-forget' utility that broadcasts your code to GitHub, GitLab, and Codeberg simultaneously. It verifies integrity with SHA-256 hashing, ensuring that no matter what happens to the platform, your work belongs to you.

## 3. Social Media Launch Post (Twitter/LinkedIn)
🚀 **Introducing Echo Git Sync**

I built a tool because I was paranoid.  
What happens if GitHub bans you tomorrow? Or GitLab goes down?

Echo Git Sync is a zero-dependency bash utility that:  
✅ Pushes code to 3+ providers simultaneously  
✅ Verifies file integrity with SHA-256  
✅ Runs locally or in CI/CD

It's free. It's open source. It's peace of mind.

## 4. HackerNews Post
**Title:** "Show HN: Echo Git Sync – Multi-provider git redundancy"

**Body:**
I built a simple bash tool to sync git repos across multiple providers (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, self-hosted).

Why: After seeing developers lose access to GitHub accounts, I wanted code redundancy without complex infrastructure.

How it works:
- Parallel push to all configured remotes
- Pre-flight connectivity checks
- SHA-256 integrity verification
- Pure bash + git (zero dependencies)

Would love feedback on the approach!

## 5. Product Hunt Submission
