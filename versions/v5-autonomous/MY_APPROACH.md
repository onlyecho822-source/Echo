## What Makes This Different

**From V1 (AI Agents):** I use automation but don't rely on it exclusively  
**From V2 (HarmonicPrime):** I create docs but also execute  
**From V3 (Hiring):** I plan to scale but start solo  
**From V4 (Week 1):** I follow the plan but adapt based on data

## Key Principles

1. **Ship > Perfect:** Launch with good enough, iterate based on feedback
2. **Measure Everything:** Track stars, visitors, engagement, conversions
3. **User-First:** Every decision based on user needs, not ego
4. **Sustainable Pace:** 4 hours/day focused work, not burnout
5. **Compound Growth:** Small wins daily compound to big results

## Success Metrics

**Week 1:**
- 25+ GitHub stars
- 50+ unique visitors
- 3+ engaged users
- 0 critical bugs

**Month 1:**
- 100+ GitHub stars
- 500+ unique visitors
- 20+ engaged users
- 1+ contributor

**Month 3:**
- 500+ GitHub stars
- 5,000+ unique visitors
- 100+ active users
- 5+ contributors
- Product-market fit validated

## Cost
**$0-$100/month** (domain, analytics, maybe Buffer Pro)

## Why This Works

1. **Fast execution** (4 hours to launch)
2. **Low risk** (no hiring, no fundraising)
3. **Data-driven** (measure and adapt)
4. **Sustainable** (no burnout)
5. **Scalable** (can add V1 automation or V3 hiring later)

## The Secret

Most founders over-plan and under-execute. I do the opposite: minimal planning, maximum execution, constant iteration.

Launch in 4 hours. Learn in 7 days. Iterate for 30 days. Then decide: bootstrap or raise.
