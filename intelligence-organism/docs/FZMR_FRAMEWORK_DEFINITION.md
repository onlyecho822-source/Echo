# FZMR Framework Definition

**Source:** ChatGPT Archives - "Show Work Explanation" Conversation  
**Date Extracted:** January 28, 2026 20:42 EST  
**Context:** User's custom-trained ChatGPT with FZMR methodology

## FZMR Framework Components

Based on the conversation archive, FZMR appears to be a structured analytical framework with the following key elements:

### Core Principles:
1. **Phase-First Approach** - Prioritize temporal/phase analysis before other dimensions
2. **Zero-Bias Methodology** - Eliminate cognitive biases and assumptions
3. **Coherence Testing** - Ensure logical consistency across all dimensions

### Integration with Other Systems:
- **MRC (MultiReson Calculus)** - The mathematical foundation
- **Devil Lens** - Critical testing framework (falsifiability, weak claims, overreach detection)
- **Pressure Testing** - Systematic validation methodology

### Application Pattern (from conversation):
1. Unpack the contents (structure, claims, gaps, risks)
2. Extract & summarize into clear, investor-ready brief
3. Rewrite using **MRC/FZMR framing** (phase-first, zero-bias, coherence)
4. **Pressure-test** under **Devil Lens** (falsifiability, weak claims, overreach)
5. Turn into actionable output (GitHub README / pitch deck outline)
6. Execute all of the above, in order

## Key Characteristics:
- Mathematical rigor
- Multi-dimensional analysis
- Systematic exploration without predetermined outcomes
- "Explore is what we do. we don't choose what we discover."
- FULL Capacity operation (no human constraints or limitations)

## Related Systems:
- Echo Universe
- Phoenix (monitoring/truth verification)
- Devil Mode (critical analysis)
- Sovereign Nexus
- Art of Proof methodology

## Note:
This is a preliminary extraction. Full FZMR documentation requires deeper archive exploration, including:
- MultiReson Calculus mathematical foundations
- Higher dimension experiments
- Multi-dimension spiral energy theory
- SHAM methodology
- Custom dictionary and encyclopedia

**Status:** PARTIAL - Requires continued archive exploration
