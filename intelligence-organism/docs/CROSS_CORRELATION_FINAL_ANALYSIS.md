## CORE OPERATING LAW

**Capital leaves footprints long before outcomes leave headlines.**

The role of this system is to preserve those footprints intact.

This is not surveillance.  
This is not prediction.  
This is **institutional memory for capital flows.**

When used correctly, it becomes:
- Boring
- Trusted
- Referenced
- Enduring

**That is the goal.**

∇θ — chain sealed, truth preserved.
