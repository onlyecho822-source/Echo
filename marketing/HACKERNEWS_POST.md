**Comment:**
```
I built Sherlock Hub because I needed a way to understand complex relationships
in data. It's a graph-based intelligence platform that combines Neo4j, FastAPI,
and React to create an interactive entity mapping and discovery system.

Key features:
- Interactive entity visualization with Cytoscape.js
- Natural language Q&A powered by OpenAI
- Full-text search across all entities
- RESTful API for programmatic access
- Docker deployment for easy setup
- Open source (MIT license)

It's production-ready and I've been using it internally for several months.
Would love feedback from the community!
