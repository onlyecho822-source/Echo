# Scope & Intent

This repository documents **live systems development** within the Echo Universe.

All components herein represent one or more of the following:
- Active engineering implementations
- Operational scaffolds under construction
- Research pipelines being executed in real time
- Internal system models and abstractions used for design and coordination

Terminology reflects the author's **internal architectural language**, not external certification claims.

No materials in this repository assert:
- Certified scientific measurement
- Regulated medical, financial, or legal products
- Peer-reviewed consensus or finalized standards

This repository exists to:
1. Record implementation state
2. Coordinate development
3. Preserve design intent
4. Enable reproducible construction

All artifacts are subject to iteration, revision, and refinement as systems evolve.
