# 📋 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHATGPT - MULTI-LLM VALIDATION

**To:** ChatGPT (OpenAI)  
**From:** Echo Universe Project  
**Date:** 2026-01-02T06:45:00Z  
**Purpose:** Real hallucination detection validation with multi-LLM collaboration

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE NEED

We're testing a hallucination detection system by comparing responses from multiple LLMs:
- Claude (Anthropic)
- ChatGPT (OpenAI) - **This is you**
- Gemini (Google)

Your responses will be recorded in GitHub and compared with Claude and Gemini to understand how different LLMs handle hallucination risk.
