# Holy Shell Hardware Specifications

## Overview

The Holy Shell is a dedicated hardware device for E.X.O.D.U.S. protocol deployment in physical sanctuary locations. It combines encrypted computation with cultural frequency generation.

## Design Philosophy

- **Sovereign Computation**: All processing occurs locally; no cloud dependencies

## Assembly Notes

### Obsidian Dust Encryption Layer

The inner enclosure is lined with obsidian dust composite. This material:
- Provides EMI/RFI shielding
- Serves symbolic function as protective boundary
- Sourced from volcanic regions with cultural significance

### Cultural Calibration

Before deployment, each Holy Shell undergoes:
1. Cipher key initialization (Sankofa ceremony)
2. GPS calibration to sanctuary coordinates
3. Frequency tuning to local harmonic baseline
4. Resonance score verification (minimum 8/10)

## Manufacturing

- Assembled in community-owned facilities
- Components sourced from ethical supply chains
- No conflict minerals
- Open hardware license (CERN OHL)
