Title: I made a tool that generates credit dispute letters for $75 (normally $500-2000 from companies)

Body:
I got frustrated paying credit repair companies hundreds of dollars to fix errors on my credit report, so I built an automated tool that does the same thing.

For $75, you get:
- AI-generated dispute letters customized to your situation
- Letters for all 3 credit bureaus
- Mailing instructions
- Follow-up templates

I'm not claiming this is magical or that it works for everyone, but if you have legitimate errors on your credit report, these letters follow the same FCRA-compliant format that the expensive companies use.

No subscription. No upsells. Just the letters.

Title: How I Removed 3 Errors From My Credit Report in 45 Days (Step-by-Step)

Body:
Last year, I found 3 errors on my credit report that were killing my score. Here's exactly what I did:

1. Got my free credit reports from annualcreditreport.com
2. Identified the errors (account I never opened, wrong balance, duplicate account)
3. Wrote formal dispute letters to all 3 bureaus
4. Sent via certified mail
5. Waited 30 days
6. All 3 errors were removed

My credit score jumped 67 points.

The hardest part was writing the letters. They need to be formal, reference the right laws, and be specific without being emotional.

I automated this process and put it at [link]. It's $75 instead of the $500+ that credit repair companies charge.

Full transparency: This only works if you have REAL errors. If you're trying to remove legitimate negative items, this won't help.

AMA about the process.

### Day 2-3: Facebook Groups
**Target Groups:**
- "Credit Repair"
- "Improve Your Credit Score"
