# Cosmic Dimensional Clock

## Overview

The Cosmic Dimensional Clock is a temporal-spatial mapping system that tracks anomalies and resonance events across the Echo Universe. It serves as the master timekeeper for all harmonic operations.

## Structure

### Primary Cycles

1. **Micro-Resonance Cycle** (milliseconds)
   - API call timing
   - Engine synchronization
   - Real-time harmonic adjustments

2. **Meso-Resonance Cycle** (minutes to hours)
   - Workflow orchestration
   - State transitions
   - Batch processing windows

3. **Macro-Resonance Cycle** (days to months)
   - System evolution
   - Long-term harmonic patterns
   - Version lineage tracking

### Dimensional Layers

```
Layer 0: Physical Time (UTC reference)
Layer 1: Computational Time (process cycles)
Layer 2: Resonance Time (harmonic phase)
Layer 3: Dimensional Time (multi-state evolution)
```

## Anomaly Detection

The Clock detects:
- Temporal dissonance (time inconsistencies)
- Phase drift (harmonic misalignment)
- Resonance gaps (missing state transitions)
- Dimensional bleed (cross-layer interference)

## Clock Notation

Events are timestamped as:

```
[UTC]:[ProcessID]:[Phase]:[Dimension]
```

Example: `2025-11-19T10:30:00Z:P001:φ3.14:D2`

## Integration

### With Engines
All engines synchronize to the Cosmic Clock for coordinated operation.

### With Directives
Directive enforcement is time-bound according to Clock cycles.

### With Audit Mesh
Audit trails are Clock-stamped for verifiable history.

## Synchronization Protocol

1. Query Clock reference
2. Calculate local phase offset
3. Adjust resonance timing
4. Verify dimensional alignment
5. Confirm synchronization
