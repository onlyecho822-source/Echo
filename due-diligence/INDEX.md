## Purpose

This package provides a comprehensive, end-to-end technical and business review of the Echo Universe project. It is designed for rigorous technical due diligence by potential acquirers, investors, or strategic partners.

This is not a sales pitch. This is an honest, unflinching assessment of what we have built, what works, what doesn't, and what it will take to achieve the vision.

- Real-world data ingestion (probes are specifications, not deployed).
- User-facing applications (Information Rooms and API are concepts).

**The Gap:**
- Not a gap of intellect or design.
- A gap of engineering and execution.
- Requires 9 world-class engineers and 3-18 months to close.

**The Opportunity:**
- A validated market gap worth $500M-$1.2B.
