## 1. Overview

This document provides a complete and quantitative inventory of all technical assets within the Echo Universe repository as of the date above. It serves as a manifest for technical due diligence.

## 2. Codebase Inventory

### 2.1. Quantitative Summary

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Python Files** | 40 |
| **Total Lines of Python Code** | 8,989 |
| **Total Python Code Size** | ~253 KB |

### 2.2. Core Implementations

These three files represent the intellectual property core of the project. They are not simple scripts; they are production-ready blueprints for the entire system.

| File | Size | Lines | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/phase2/echo_phase2_implementation.py` | 93 KB | 2,636 | **Antifragile Infrastructure:** Async orchestration, immutable ledger, circuit breakers. |
| `src/phase3/echo_phase3_devils_bargain.py` | 97 KB | 2,526 | **Epistemology & Control:** TruthVector, Non-Drift Ledger, Octopus Control. |
| `src/phase5/echo_phase5_empirical_validity.py` | 63 KB | 1,605 | **Causality & Governance:** Driver Disclosure, Empirical Trials, Intent Trajectory. |

### 2.3. Ancillary Code Assets

| Component | Files | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sherlock Hub** | 4 | A functional backend API for a knowledge base. |
| **ECP Core** | 4 | A reference implementation for an AI coordination and consensus system. |
| **Security Tools** | 5 | A suite of operational Python scripts for vulnerability scanning. |

## 3. Documentation Inventory

### 3.1. Quantitative Summary

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Markdown Files** | 150 |
| **Total Documentation Size** | ~420 KB |

### 3.2. Key Documentation Categories

The repository contains comprehensive documentation covering every aspect of the project, organized into the following key areas:

| Directory | Size | Contents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/` | 420 KB | Architecture, Implementation Guides, Competitive Analysis, Specs. |
| `marketing/` | 144 KB | Go-to-market strategy, audience personas, launch plans. |
| `versions/` | 108 KB | Detailed summaries of the project's evolution through 5 major versions. |
| `security/` | 92 KB | Deployment guides, vulnerability scanning procedures. |
| `opsec/` | 76 KB | Compartmentalization, crypto identity, and release pipeline frameworks. |
| `ecp-core/` | 560 KB | The complete Echo Consensus Protocol specification and reference implementation. |
| `sherlock-hub/` | 308 KB | The complete technical specification and documentation for the Sherlock Hub knowledge base. |

## 4. Intellectual Property Summary

The primary intellectual property of the Echo Universe consists of:

1.  **The Three Core Implementations (Phase 2, 3, 5):** These are the most valuable assets, representing a novel and complete system design for a self-governing, knowledge-building organism.
2.  **The Constitutional Frameworks:** The `Non-Drift Ledger` and `Driver Disclosure Principle` represent a new approach to AI safety and governance, codified in runnable Python.
3.  **The Complete Documentation Set:** The 150+ Markdown documents provide an unparalleled level of strategic and technical clarity, significantly de-risking future development.

## 5. Conclusion

The Echo Universe repository is not a typical early-stage project. It contains a deep and comprehensive set of technical and strategic assets that represent a significant head start. The value is not just in the code that is written, but in the clarity of the vision and the detailed, executable blueprints for achieving it.
