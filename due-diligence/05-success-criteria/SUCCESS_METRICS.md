## 1. Introduction

This document defines the key performance indicators (KPIs) and success metrics for the Echo Universe project across three horizons. It provides a clear framework for measuring progress and de-risking the project for a potential acquirer.

## 2. Horizon 1 (0-3 Months): Foundational Success

**Goal:** Prove technical viability and deliver the first tangible asset.

| Metric | Target | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure Deployment** | 100% | Kubernetes cluster, databases, and CI/CD are live. |
| **Core Services Refactoring** | 100% | Phase 2 implementation is refactored into microservices. |
| **Probe Deployment** | 5-10 | Dependency Mapping Probes are deployed to multiple cloud locations. |
| **Data Ingestion Rate** | >1,000 pods/day | Real-time data is flowing into the Immutable Ledger. |
| **Global Dependency Graph** | >10,000 nodes | The internal dashboard visualizes a meaningful portion of the internet. |
| **Initial Team Hired** | 9 people | Head of Engineering and initial team of 8 are hired. |

**Definition of Success for Horizon 1:** We have successfully transformed the brilliant blueprints into a functioning, data-gathering system. We have a live, internal product that demonstrates the core value proposition.

## 3. Horizon 2 (3-9 Months): Commercial Success

**Goal:** Prove market viability and achieve first revenue.

| Metric | Target | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Echo Library API Users** | >50 | Paying customers for the GraphQL API. |
| **Information Rooms Users** | >100 | Paying, verified members in the collaborative spaces. |
| **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** | >$25,000 | The project is generating meaningful, recurring revenue. |
| **Phase 3 Integration** | 100% | The Epistemological Engine is integrated and operational. |
| **Signal Harvester Deployment** | 3 | Harvesters for Reddit, GitHub, and Twitter are live. |

**Definition of Success for Horizon 2:** We have successfully found product-market fit. We have a growing community of paying users and a clear path to profitability.

## 4. Horizon 3 (9-18+ Months): Strategic Success

**Goal:** Achieve the full vision of an autonomous, self-governing system.

| Metric | Target | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 5 Integration** | 100% | The Causality Sandbox and DDP are fully operational. |
| **Autonomous Actions** | >10/day | The system is taking and learning from its own actions. |
| **Causality Experiments** | >50 | The Causality Sandbox has run numerous validated experiments. |
| **Community Growth** | >1,000 users | The Information Rooms are a thriving, self-sustaining community. |
| **Market Leadership** | Top 3 | Echo is recognized as a market leader in internet intelligence. |

**Definition of Success for Horizon 3:** We have created a new category and a defensible moat. The system is not just a product; it is a self-improving, autonomous organism that has fundamentally changed our understanding of the internet.

## 5. Conclusion for Due Diligence

These metrics provide a clear, quantitative framework for evaluating the success of the Echo Universe project. They demonstrate a phased, de-risked approach that prioritizes technical viability first, followed by commercial traction, and finally, the full realization of the strategic vision.

A potential acquirer can use this roadmap to track progress and gain confidence that the project is on a path to delivering a significant return on investment.
