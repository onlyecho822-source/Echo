## Phoenix Framework Integration

### 0-9 Numeric Ontology Mapping

**0 (Void/Potential):** $140B unclaimed benefits = unrealized potential  
**1 (Unity/Identity):** Single household = unit of analysis  
**2 (Duality/Choice):** Eligible vs. ineligible = binary determination  
**3 (Structure/Form):** 10 benefit programs = structural framework  
**4 (Stability/Foundation):** Federal Poverty Level = stable measurement  
**5 (Change/Dynamics):** Annual renewal = recurring transformation  
**6 (Balance/Harmony):** Technology + human = balanced approach  
**7 (Reflection/Consciousness):** Impact measurement = awareness of outcomes  
**8 (Infinity/Cycles):** Sustainable model = infinite loop of benefit  
**9 (Completion/Integration):** $25,911 realized = full integration of potential

### Ouroboros Operators Applied

**Ω₀ (Emergence):** Calculator emerged from sector scan  
**Ω₁ (Transformation):** Potential → realized benefits  
**Ω₂ (Recursion):** Each enrollment enables next enrollment  
**Ω₃ (Synthesis):** Multiple programs synthesized into total value  
**Ω₄ (Transcendence):** Individual benefit → systemic change
