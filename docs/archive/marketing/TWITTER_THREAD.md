I built Sherlock Hub because I needed a way to understand complex relationships in data. It's a graph-based intelligence platform that combines Neo4j, FastAPI, and React.

The solution: Sherlock Hub gives you an interactive graph visualization where you can explore relationships, discover patterns, and ask questions about your data.
