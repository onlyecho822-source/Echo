---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. No Estimated Values Displayed

GSAAuctions.gov does not display estimated values on auction listings. The platform only provides:
- Current bid amounts
- Reserve price status (yes/no, amount not disclosed)
- Bid increments
- Number of bidders

This limitation prevents direct application of the original filter criterion "estimated value >$1000 and current bid <50% of value."

### 2. High Barriers for Aircraft

Military aircraft (KC-10s) have significant acquisition barriers:
- End Use Certification (EUC) required through Department of Defense
- 30-60 day approval process
- Demilitarization required (~$35,000 per aircraft)
- Coordination with AMARG facility
- Non-flyable condition

### 3. Strong Market Interest in Mid-Range Items

Items in the $500-$3,000 range show the highest bidding activity (6-10 bidders), suggesting these represent the best balance of value and accessibility for resellers.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions

1. **Focus on Travel Trailers** - Five trailers closing today with strong bidding activity ($218-$835 range). These show high market demand and lower barriers to resale.

2. **Monitor Computer Equipment Pages** - With 144 items total, pages 2-6 likely contain higher-value electronics not visible on page 1.

3. **Research Market Values** - Since GSA doesn't provide estimates, independent market research is essential to identify undervalued items.

### Strategic Opportunities

1. **Beechcraft T-34C Aircraft** - More accessible than KC-10s, training aircraft market may offer better ROI.

2. **Global 5000 Business Jet** - At $1.25M with 2 bidders, this represents a potentially viable aircraft opportunity compared to military surplus.

3. **Spent Brass** - At $8,120 with 7 bidders, scrap metal shows strong market demand.

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Avoid KC-10 Aircraft** - Unless experienced with military surplus and demilitarization processes, the $35K+ additional costs and 60-day delays present significant risks.

2. **Verify Condition** - GSA auctions are "as-is" with no warranties. Physical inspection highly recommended before bidding.

3. **Calculate Total Costs** - Factor in removal, transportation, storage, and any required modifications or certifications.
