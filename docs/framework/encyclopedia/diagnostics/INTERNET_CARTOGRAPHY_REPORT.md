## Abstract

This report provides a diagnostic analysis of the global internet infrastructure, applying the Echo Universe framework to map the true structure of network control. Our findings indicate that the internet, contrary to its popular image as a decentralized network, is a highly centralized system characterized by significant power concentrations at the physical, routing, and naming layers. This report identifies the key actors, structural dependencies, and systemic risks inherent in the current architecture. We conclude that the internet is suffering from "centralization sickness," a condition that increases systemic risk and creates a governance gap between the network's technical reality and its political and economic governance. This report serves as the first proof-of-concept for the Echo Universe diagnostic methodology.

## 1. Introduction: The Illusion of Decentralization

The prevailing cognitive model of the internet is that of a decentralized, resilient, and globally distributed network—a "network of networks." This report challenges that perception. By applying a multi-layered diagnostic approach, we reveal a system that is increasingly centralized, brittle, and controlled by a small number of corporate and state actors. This is not a moral judgment, but a structural diagnosis. Understanding the internet's true architecture is the first step toward building more resilient and equitable governance models.

This report is the first in a series of diagnostic analyses from the Echo Universe Research Program, which aims to apply a systemic, biological lens to complex socio-technical systems.

## 2. Methodology: Echo Universe Diagnostic Framework

We applied the Echo Universe framework to analyze the internet as a living organism, examining its anatomy and its existence across multiple layers of reality.

- **Echo Anatomy:** We mapped the internet's infrastructure to the biological systems of a living organism (skeletal, circulatory, nervous, metabolic) to understand its functional dependencies.
- **MultiState Reality:** We analyzed the internet across five simultaneous layers of reality (physical, logical, economic, political, cognitive) to understand the interplay between its technical architecture and its social and political context.

Data was gathered from publicly available sources, including TeleGeography, IANA, Wikipedia, and investigative journalism from sources such as CNBC. All data is from Q4 2025.

## 3. Findings: The Four Layers of Internet Control

Our analysis identified four key layers of control in the internet's architecture:

### 3.1. Layer 1: The Physical Layer (Submarine Cables)

The physical backbone of the internet is a network of over 500 submarine fiber optic cables. Our analysis reveals a significant concentration of ownership and control.

**Finding 1: Tech giants now control approximately 50% of global undersea cable capacity.**

> "About ten years ago, we saw the advent of another big category, which is the webscale players and the likes of Meta, Google, Amazon, etc., who represent now probably 50% of the overall market" - Paul Gabla, Alcatel Submarine Networks [1]

This represents a major shift from the traditional telecom consortium model to a sole ownership model, where tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon have unilateral control over their infrastructure. This is driven by the massive data requirements of AI and cloud computing.

**Table 1: Major Tech Giant Submarine Cable Projects**

| Company | Project | Scale | Ownership Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Meta** | Waterworth | 50,000 km (longest in world) | Sole Owner |
| **Google** | 30+ cables | Largest single owner | Mixed (consortium & sole) |
| **Amazon** | Fastnet | 320 Tbps capacity | Sole Owner |

**Geographic Concentration:** The physical infrastructure is also highly concentrated geographically, with major chokepoints in the English Channel, the Red Sea, and the Strait of Malacca. This creates single points of failure that can have global consequences.

### 3.2. Layer 2: The Routing Layer (Tier 1 Networks)

The global routing system is controlled by a small number of Tier 1 Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that can reach the entire internet without paying for transit.

**Finding 2: Fourteen companies control the global internet routing backbone.**

These companies, a mix of US, European, and Asian telecom giants, form the "heart" of the internet's circulatory system. However, their role is being diminished by the rise of hyperscale content providers who are building their own private backbones and bypassing the traditional Tier 1 system.

**Table 2: Geographic Distribution of Tier 1 ISP Headquarters**

| Region | Number of Tier 1 ISPs |
| :--- | :--- |
| **USA** | 5 (36%) |
| **Europe** | 6 (43%) |
| **Asia** | 3 (21%) |
| **Africa** | 0 |
| **South America** | 0 |

This geographic concentration means that countries in the Global South have no representation at the core of the internet's routing infrastructure.

### 3.3. Layer 3: The Naming Layer (DNS Root Servers)

The Domain Name System (DNS), which translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, is controlled by 13 root server operators.

**Finding 3: 77% of the DNS root server system is under US jurisdiction.**

Of the 13 root server operators, 10 are US-based entities. This includes two operated by the US military (Department of Defense and Army Research Lab) and two operated by a single private company, Verisign.

**Table 3: DNS Root Server Operator Jurisdiction**

| Jurisdiction | Number of Operators | Percentage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **USA** | 10 | 77% |
| **Sweden** | 1 | 8% |
| **Netherlands** | 1 | 8% |
| **Japan** | 1 | 8% |

This represents a significant concentration of power over the internet's naming system. While ICANN, a US-based non-profit, manages the content of the root zone under a "multistakeholder" model, the physical and operational control of the root servers is highly centralized.

### 3.4. Layer 4: The Content Layer (Hyperscale Networks)

The vast majority of internet traffic is generated by a handful of hyperscale content providers.

**Finding 4: Five companies generate approximately 75% of all used international bandwidth.**

These companies—Google (YouTube), Meta (Facebook, Instagram), Amazon (AWS, Prime Video), Microsoft (Azure, Xbox), and Netflix—have become the de facto metabolic engine of the internet. Their content is the primary "food" that the network consumes. This creates a content monoculture and gives these companies immense power over what users see and experience online.

## 4. Systemic Diagnosis: Centralization Sickness

Applying the Echo Universe diagnostic framework, we can identify three systemic conditions affecting the internet:

**1. Centralization Sickness:** The internet is suffering from a severe case of centralization sickness. What was designed as a distributed, resilient network is evolving into a centralized, brittle one. This is evident across all four layers of control.

**2. Governance Gap Disorder:** The internet's governance structures have not kept pace with its technological and economic evolution. The "multistakeholder" model lacks enforcement power and is dominated by corporate and US interests, creating a significant gap between the internet's global user base and its centralized control structure.

**3. Two-Tiered Health System:** The rise of private backbones owned by hyperscalers is creating a two-tiered internet. A fast, efficient, private internet for the wealthy tech giants, and a slower, public internet for everyone else. This threatens the principle of net neutrality and creates a new digital divide.

## 5. Conclusion: The Internet is Not a Cloud

The primary conclusion of this report is that the internet is not an ethereal, decentralized cloud. It is a physical, centralized system with clear points of control and vulnerability. The illusion of decentralization masks a reality of concentrated power.

This diagnosis has significant implications for internet governance, security, and equity. Any meaningful discussion about the future of the internet must begin with an honest assessment of its true architecture. This report provides that assessment, demonstrating the power of the Echo Universe framework to diagnose complex socio-technical systems.

Future research will apply this framework to other complex systems, from corporate governance to social media platforms, to continue mapping the hidden structures of power in our digital world.
