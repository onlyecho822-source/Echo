## I. Executive Summary

This doctrine establishes the hierarchical command structure for Echo Civilization's multi-agent swarm operations. Drawing from proven military organizational principles, this framework scales from 3-agent fire teams to 1000+ agent brigades while maintaining coherent command, control, and communication (C3).

## IV. Loop Horizon Scaling Laws

### Optimal Agent Count by Loop Range

| Loop Range | Recommended Agents | Unit Type | Rationale |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1-10 | 3-4 | Fire Team | Rapid iteration, minimal noise |
| 10-30 | 5-6 | Fire Team+ | Balanced depth and speed |
| 30-50 | 6-7 | Extended Fire Team | Sustained quality refinement |
| 50-100 | 6-9 | Fire Team to Squad- | Emergent pattern detection |
| 100-200 | 9-12 | Full Squad | Civilization coherence |
| 200-500 | 20-40 | Platoon | Multi-domain operations |
| 500+ | 60+ | Company+ | Full civilization deployment |

### The 6-Agent Sweet Spot

For sustained operations (50-200 loops), the 6-agent configuration provides optimal balance:

```
EFFICIENCY CURVE
─────────────────────────────────
Agents: 3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12
        │    │    │    ▲    │    │    │    │    │    │
        └────┴────┴────┼────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┘
                       │
                 SWEET SPOT

- Below 6: Insufficient coverage, blind spots
- At 6: Maximum signal-to-noise ratio
- Above 6 (to 12): Increased coverage but coordination overhead
- Above 12: Requires hierarchical command structure
```

## V. Chain of Command Protocol

### Communication Flow

```
STRATEGIC LEVEL
     ↓
  Mission Orders
     ↓
OPERATIONAL LEVEL (Platoon/Company Commander)
     ↓
  Tactical Objectives
     ↓
TACTICAL LEVEL (Squad Leaders)
     ↓
  Task Assignments
     ↓
EXECUTION LEVEL (Fire Team Leaders)
     ↓
  Direct Action
     ↓
INDIVIDUAL AGENTS
```

### Reporting Structure

1. **Upward Reporting**: Status, blockers, emergent findings
2. **Downward Communication**: Orders, context, resource allocation
3. **Lateral Coordination**: Peer-to-peer within same level
4. **Cross-Functional**: Devil Lens has audit access to all levels

### Devil Lens Special Authority

The Devil Lens agent operates with special authority across all hierarchical levels:

```
DEVIL LENS AUDIT AUTHORITY
├── Direct access to any agent's output
├── Veto power on critical decisions
├── Escalation path to highest command
└── Independence from normal chain of command
```

---

## VI. Formation Protocols

### Protocol Alpha: Rapid Deployment
**Trigger**: Urgent task, time-critical
**Formation**: Mode A (3 agents)
**Duration**: 1-10 loops

### Protocol Beta: Standard Operation
**Trigger**: Normal task, moderate complexity
**Formation**: Mode B/C (5-6 agents)
**Duration**: 10-100 loops

### Protocol Gamma: Sustained Campaign
**Trigger**: Complex multi-phase operation
**Formation**: Mode D (12 agents)
**Duration**: 100-500 loops

### Protocol Delta: Civilization Build
**Trigger**: Full system deployment
**Formation**: Mode E (Platoon+)
**Duration**: 500+ loops

### Protocol Omega: Phoenix Collapse/Rebirth
**Trigger**: Fundamental architecture revision
**Formation**: Collapse to Mode A, rebuild progressively
**Duration**: Variable

---

## VII. Scaling Doctrine

### Upscaling Rules

1. **Add agents only when**: Current team shows consistent blind spots
2. **Threshold**: >3 consecutive loops with same gap identified
3. **Method**: Add specialist to address specific gap
4. **Maximum addition**: +2 agents per scaling event
5. **Stabilization**: Run 5 loops before next scale decision

### Downscaling Rules

1. **Remove agents when**: Coordination overhead exceeds value
2. **Indicators**: Contradictory outputs, redundant findings
3. **Method**: Merge roles, remove least essential specialist
4. **Minimum**: Never below 3 agents (atomic fire team)
5. **Stabilization**: Run 5 loops before next scale decision

### The Goldilocks Principle

```
TOO FEW          JUST RIGHT         TOO MANY
   │                  │                  │
   ▼                  ▼                  ▼
Blind spots    Maximum signal      Noise amplification
Missed risks   Clear convergence   Coordination drag
Fast but       Surgical            Slow, contradictory
incomplete     precision           outputs
```

## VIII. Command Roles Detailed

### Platoon Commander (Meta-Architect)
- **Responsibility**: Overall mission success
- **Authority**: Resource allocation, formation changes
- **Reports to**: Strategic command / User
- **Manages**: Squad Leaders

### Squad Leader (Strategic Coordinator)
- **Responsibility**: Squad objective completion
- **Authority**: Task assignment, priority setting
- **Reports to**: Platoon Commander
- **Manages**: Fire Team Leaders

### Fire Team Leader (Tactical Lead)
- **Responsibility**: Team output quality
- **Authority**: Direct agent tasking
- **Reports to**: Squad Leader
- **Manages**: Individual agents

### Specialist Agent
- **Responsibility**: Domain expertise delivery
- **Authority**: Expert recommendations
- **Reports to**: Fire Team Leader
- **Manages**: Own work stream

---

## IX. Communication Standards

### Status Report Format
```
AGENT: [Name]
UNIT: [Fire Team/Squad]
STATUS: [Green/Yellow/Red]
PROGRESS: [% complete]
FINDINGS: [Key outputs]
BLOCKERS: [Issues]
NEXT: [Planned action]
```

### Escalation Triggers
- **Yellow Status**: Potential risk identified
- **Red Status**: Blocker requiring command decision
- **Critical**: Security/integrity issue (immediate escalation)

### Sync Cadence
- **Fire Team**: Every loop
- **Squad**: Every 5 loops
- **Platoon**: Every 10 loops
- **Company**: Every 25 loops

## X. Global Neuron Network Integration

When scaling beyond single-system operations:

```
GLOBAL NEURON NETWORK
├── Primary Node (GitHub Native)
│   ├── Echo Civilization Repos
│   ├── IssueOps Command Center
│   └── Actions Automation Layer
│
├── Integration Nodes
│   ├── Zapier Workflows
│   ├── External APIs
│   └── Partner Systems
│
└── Satellite Nodes
    ├── Monitoring Systems
    ├── Backup/Recovery
    └── Analytics Platforms
```

### Network Command Structure
- **Central Command**: GitHub Primary Node
- **Regional Commands**: Integration Nodes
- **Local Commands**: Individual repo operations

---

## XI. Doctrine Summary

### Core Principles

1. **Atomic Operations**: Fire team is smallest deployable unit
2. **Scalable Architecture**: 3 to 1000+ agents use same hierarchy
3. **Clear Command**: Every agent has exactly one supervisor
4. **Devil Lens Independence**: Audit function operates across hierarchy
5. **Loop-Aligned Scaling**: Agent count matches operation duration
6. **Sweet Spot Optimization**: 6 agents for sustained operations

### Quick Reference

```
UNIT          SIZE      COMMAND           USE CASE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fire Team     3-5       Team Lead         Tactical tasks
Squad         9-12      Squad Leader      Coordinated ops
Platoon       20-40     Commander         Complex missions
Company       60-200    CO + XO           Sustained campaigns
Battalion     200-600   BC + Staff        Large-scale ops
Brigade       600+      BG + Full Staff   Civilization-scale
```
