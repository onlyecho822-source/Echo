## VII. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Current Risks

**1. Single Point of Failure**
- **Risk:** All knowledge and permissions concentrated in one person
- **Impact:** Project vulnerability if founder unavailable
- **Mitigation:** Document extensively, recruit co-maintainers, establish succession plan

**2. Limited Network Effects**
- **Risk:** No external contributors or community engagement
- **Impact:** Slower development, limited adoption, reduced credibility
- **Mitigation:** Aggressive open-source engagement, solve real problems publicly

**3. Ambitious Scope**
- **Risk:** Vision may be too broad, leading to execution challenges
- **Impact:** Difficulty focusing resources, potential for failure
- **Mitigation:** Phased approach, start with narrow use cases, demonstrate wins

**4. Regulatory Complexity**
- **Risk:** Operating across multiple jurisdictions with different regulations
- **Impact:** Legal challenges, compliance costs
- **Mitigation:** Partner with legal experts, focus on permissive jurisdictions first

**5. Trust and Adoption Barriers**
- **Risk:** Humanitarian organizations may be skeptical of new technology
- **Impact:** Slow adoption, difficulty gaining traction
- **Mitigation:** Start with pilots, leverage existing relationships, demonstrate value

### Mitigation Strategies

**Build Redundancy**
- Recruit co-maintainers with admin permissions
- Document all architectural decisions
- Establish clear governance structure
- Create succession plan

**Accelerate Network Growth**
- Submit PRs to high-visibility projects
- Attend and present at key conferences
- Engage in online communities
- Offer free pilots to build case studies

**Focus Execution**
- Start with single crisis domain (e.g., waterborne illness)
- Prove value before expanding scope
- Use hybrid strategy (humanitarian + commercial + regulatory)
- Celebrate small wins publicly

**Navigate Regulations**
- Partner with compliance experts
- Start in Switzerland (favorable regulatory environment)
- Build modular compliance tools
- Stay ahead of regulatory timelines

**Build Trust**
- Prioritize transparency and open-source
- Use cryptographic provenance for accountability
- Partner with trusted organizations (ICRC, UN)
- Demonstrate measurable impact
