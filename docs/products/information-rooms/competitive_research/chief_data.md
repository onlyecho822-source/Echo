- **Limited to women/non-binary** - Excludes 50% of market
- **Geographic constraints** - Clubhouses only in select cities
- **Narrow vertical** - Only senior executives, not broader professional community
- **High price point** - $5,800-$7,900 may limit individual membership

2. **Collaborative workspaces** - Building together, not just networking
3. **Knowledge permanence** - Information rooms create lasting artifacts
4. **Expertise-based access** - Reputation design based on skills, not titles
5. **Digital-first** - Not dependent on physical locations
6. **Cross-industry collaboration** - Bringing diverse expertise together
7. **Lower price points** - More accessible tiers ($500-$50,000 vs $5,800-$7,900)
