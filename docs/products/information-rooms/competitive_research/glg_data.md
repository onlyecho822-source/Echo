## Relevance to Information Rooms

GLG operates in a related but distinct space from Information Rooms. GLG is a **transactional expert marketplace** while Information Rooms would be a **collaborative community platform**.

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | GLG | Information Rooms |
|---------|-----|-------------------|
| **Model** | Transactional consultations | Collaborative community |
| **Access** | B2B enterprise only | Individual professionals |
| **Price** | $50K-$500K+ annual | $500-$50K individual |
| **Expert Role** | Paid consultants | Community members |
| **Interaction** | 1-on-1 calls | Many-to-many collaboration |
| **Knowledge** | Private insights | Shared knowledge base |
| **Duration** | One-off or project-based | Ongoing membership |
| **Reputation** | Internal ratings | Portable digital reputation |
| **Workspaces** | None | Shared sandboxes |

**Differentiation Opportunities:**

1. **Community vs. Marketplace** - Information Rooms builds lasting relationships, not transactions
2. **Peer Collaboration** - Experts work together, not just consult separately
3. **Accessible Pricing** - Individual professionals can join, not just enterprises
4. **Reputation Building** - Members build portable digital reputation
5. **Knowledge Permanence** - Shared artifacts and resources
6. **Cross-Industry Collaboration** - Diverse experts building together
7. **Ownership** - Members co-create value, not just provide services

GLG serves a complementary market (enterprise research needs) while Information Rooms would serve individual professionals seeking curated collaboration spaces.
