# Echo Nexus Architecture Overview

## System Design

Echo Nexus is designed as a distributed, modular intelligence platform with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Principles

1. **Modularity** - Independent, composable components
2. **Resonance** - Harmonic coordination between modules
3. **Integrity** - Cryptographic verification throughout
4. **Adaptability** - Dynamic capability adjustment
5. **Transparency** - Full auditability

## Component Layers

### Layer 1: Core
- Orchestrator
- Event Bus
- Configuration Management

### Layer 2: Engines
- Memory Nexus
- Manifold
- EchoVault
- Elasticity Matrix

### Layer 3: Frameworks
- Fabric of Zero
- Dormant Disruption
- Harmonic Symphony

### Layer 4: Products
- Echo Capsules
- Luminax
- EchoMap

### Layer 5: Security
- Dimensional Shield
- Fractal Encryption

## Data Flow

```
User Request → API Gateway → Orchestrator → Engine(s) → Response
                    ↓
              Event Bus → Other Components
```

## Deployment Models

- **Standalone**: Single-node deployment
- **Distributed**: Multi-node cluster
- **Hybrid**: Mix of local and cloud
