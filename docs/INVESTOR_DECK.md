## Slide 2: The Problem

# $50B+ Annual Cost of System Instability

**The Hidden Crisis:**
- **40% of enterprise outages are preventable** but go undetected until failure
- **Compliance failures** cost companies millions in penalties and reputation damage
- **Revenue leakage** from undetected opportunities costs 15-30% of potential earnings
- **System complexity** is increasing faster than monitoring tools can handle

**Current Solutions Fall Short:**
- Monitoring tools **alert after** problems occur
- Compliance is manual, expensive, and error-prone
- Revenue intelligence is siloed and reactive
- No integrated solution exists

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

# Echo Control Framework
## Monitor → Predict → Intervene → Optimize

**Revolutionary Approach:**
- **Predictive** rather than reactive monitoring
- **Automated intervention** before failures occur
- **Integrated stack** from stability to revenue
- **Domain-agnostic** framework applicable across industries

**Validated Results:**
- 40-60% reduction in system failures
- 50% reduction in compliance costs
- 15-30% increase in automated revenue
- 25% productivity improvement through wellness optimization
