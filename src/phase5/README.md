# Phase 5: Empirical Validity Branch - Causality & Transparency

This directory contains the Phase 5 implementation - the governance layer that ensures agentic transparency and enables causal validation.

## Key Components

- **Driver Disclosure Principle (DDP)**: Intent Trajectory Reports for all agentic actions
- **Empirical Validity Branch**: Causality sandbox for hypothesis testing
- **Causality Sandbox**: Controlled experiments with statistical validation

## Implementation

- `echo_phase5_empirical_validity.py`: Complete Phase 5 implementation (1,605 lines)

## Usage

This layer is integrated into Phase 3. It governs all agentic actions and provides the causality testing framework.

See `/docs/implementation_guides/ECHO_UNIVERSE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for integration details.
