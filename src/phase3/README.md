# Phase 3: Devil's Bargain - Epistemology & Control

This directory contains the Phase 3 implementation - the central nervous system that transforms data into knowledge while maintaining constitutional integrity.

## Key Components

- **Core Epistemological Engine**: TruthVector representation with confidence scores
- **Non-Drift Ledger**: Constitutional erosion detection and prevention
- **Non-Advocacy Permission Protocol**: Ensures neutral explanation, not advocacy
- **Octopus Control System**: Distributed, resilient control architecture

## Implementation

- `echo_phase3_devils_bargain.py`: Complete Phase 3 implementation (2,526 lines)

## Usage

This is the main orchestrator. Run via:

```python
from src.phase3.echo_phase3_devils_bargain import EchoV3
asyncio.run(EchoV3().run_universe_cycle())
```

See `/docs/implementation_guides/ECHO_UNIVERSE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for details.
