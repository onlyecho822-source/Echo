# Fear of Success

**Subtext:** *Why We Run From the Very Thing We Were Born to Do*

---

## Overview

A raw manifesto for the quiet geniuses, the near-greats, and the ones who almost leapt.

This book explores how **trauma, guilt, and inherited limitation** hold us back—not from failure, but from greatness.

It's not about fixing your fears. It's about **redefining your relationship with power**, visibility, and destiny.

## Core Themes

- **Self-Sabotage** — The hidden patterns that keep us small
- **Trauma Response** — How past wounds become future barriers

## Purpose

Most books teach you how to overcome failure.

This book addresses the harder truth: **you're not afraid of failing—you're afraid of what happens when you succeed.**

What happens when you can no longer hide? When the world expects you to keep rising? When success demands you become someone you've never allowed yourself to be?
