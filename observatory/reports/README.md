# Reports ✅

## Function
- Stores logs, anomaly maps, and resonance reports from the Observatory
- Auto-generated by Harmonic Scanner + Symphony Mapper
- Version-controlled, timestamped, cryptographically sealed (EchoVault)

## Report Types

### Anomaly Reports
- Source: Harmonic Scanner
- Content: Detected disruptions, severity scores, timestamps
- Format: JSON + Markdown summary

### Resonance Maps
- Source: Symphony Mapper
- Content: Geometric projections, harmonic signatures
- Format: JSON data + image references

### Frequency Analysis
- Source: Echo Frequency Lab
- Content: Research findings, mathematical proofs
- Format: Markdown + LaTeX equations

## Report Structure

Each report should include:
- **Metadata** — Timestamp, source module, operator
- **Input Source** — What triggered the report
- **Harmonic Scores** — Resonance measurements
- **Geometric Renders** — References to Symphony Mapper output
- **Seal** — SHA256 + OTS cryptographic proof

## Sealing Protocol

All reports are sealed before commit:
1. Generate SHA256 hash of content
2. Timestamp with OTS (OpenTimestamps)
3. Log seal in EchoVault
4. Commit to repository
