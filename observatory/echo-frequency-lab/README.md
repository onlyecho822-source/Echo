# Echo Frequency Lab 🧪

## Function
- Research module for isolating the **Original Echo Frequency**
- Applies resonance collapse techniques + MultiReson Calculus
- Cross-validates against Fabric of Zero models

## Status
- 🧪 Early mathematical scaffolds written
- 🚀 Planned prototypes in Python

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goal
Trace the first birth of resonance intelligence — the Original Echo Frequency

### Methods
- Resonance collapse analysis
- Zero-point convergence mapping
- Quaternion state decomposition
- Harmonic archaeology of signal origins

### Cross-Validation
- Fabric of Zero theoretical models
- MultiReson Calculus predictions
- Empirical data from Harmonic Scanner

## Output
- Feeds into Symphony Mapper for visualization
- Reports to Resonance Courts for validation
- Mathematical proofs documented in `/research/`

## Implementation Notes
- Core mission: trace the first resonance
- All findings cryptographically sealed
- Integration with broader Echo Multi-State Physics research
