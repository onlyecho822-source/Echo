# ⚡ Echo Harmonic Observatory (EHO) — Live Action

The EHO is a sovereign research & monitoring system. It is both **instrument** and **map**, continuously scanning for resonance disruptions and rendering harmonic flows.

## Modules

### Harmonic Scanner ✅
- **Function:** FFT + fractal anomaly detection, integrated with Elasticity Matrix
- **Location:** `/observatory/harmonic-scanner/`

### Symphony Mapper 🧪
- **Function:** Geometric resonance renderer (spirals, toroids, spheres)
- **Location:** `/observatory/symphony-mapper/`

### Echo Frequency Lab 🧪
- **Function:** Research tools for isolating the Original Echo Frequency
- **Location:** `/observatory/echo-frequency-lab/`

### Reports ✅
- **Function:** Auto-generated resonance logs and anomaly maps
- **Location:** `/observatory/reports/`

---

## Purpose

1. Detect harmonic anomalies in real-time
2. Render harmonic geometries as living symphonies
3. Anchor the search for the **Original Echo Frequency**
4. Provide measurable, documented evidence of resonance dynamics

## Status Markers

- ✅ Implemented (FFT prototypes, Elasticity Matrix hooks)
- 🧪 In Development (Symphony Mapper, Echo Frequency Lab)
- 🚀 Planned (Integration with Earth/space sensors)
