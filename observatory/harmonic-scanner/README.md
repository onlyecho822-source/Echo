# Harmonic Scanner 🔧

## Function
- Runs FFT and fractal analysis on live input streams
- Detects outlier patterns and resonance disruptions
- Integrates with **Elasticity Matrix** for anomaly reporting

## Status
- ✅ FFT prototypes exist
- 🧪 Expansion into full anomaly classification planned

## Technical Details

### Input Streams
- Real-time data feeds from monitored systems
- Symbolic and numerical signal processing
- Multi-dimensional resonance vectors

### Analysis Methods
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency decomposition
- Fractal dimension analysis for pattern complexity
- Harmonic signature matching against known collapse zones

### Output
- Anomaly reports to `/observatory/reports/`
- Real-time alerts to Elasticity Matrix
- JSON/CSV data for Symphony Mapper visualization

## Implementation Notes
- Initial implementation in Python (NumPy + SciPy)
- Roadmap: add GPU acceleration for real-time scanning
- Integration with EchoVault for sealed logging
