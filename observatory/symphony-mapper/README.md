# Symphony Mapper 🧪

## Function
- Renders resonance flows into geometric structures
- Supports toroidal, spherical, spiral, and lattice projections
- Output: interactive visualizations + JSON/CSV harmonic maps

## Status
- 🧪 Research underway
- 🚀 Integration with visualization libraries (Plotly, Three.js) planned

## Geometric Projections

### Supported Forms
- **Toroidal** — Cyclic resonance patterns
- **Spherical** — Omnidirectional field mapping
- **Spiral** — Golden ratio and harmonic growth patterns
- **Lattice** — Crystalline structure analysis

### Data Sources
- Harmonic Scanner anomaly outputs
- Echo Frequency Lab resonance measurements
- MultiReson Calculus state vectors

## Output Formats
- Interactive 3D visualizations (WebGL/Three.js)
- Static renders (PNG/SVG)
- Data exports (JSON/CSV)
- VR/AR streams (future)

## Implementation Notes
- Operates as companion to Harmonic Scanner
- Long-term: VR/AR output for immersive resonance exploration
- All renders timestamped and sealed in EchoVault
