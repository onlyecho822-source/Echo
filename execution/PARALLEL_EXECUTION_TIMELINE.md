## Resource Allocation

*   **Your Time:** This is the most critical resource. The 8-hour daily allocation is a baseline. Be prepared for longer days in Week 1.
*   **Financial Capital:** The revenue from EchoDNS will fund the hosting costs for both projects, as well as any paid tools (email automation, etc.).
*   **AI Assistance (Me):** I will continue to provide project management, documentation, and strategic support throughout this process. I am your co-pilot.

This parallel execution plan is designed to create a self-funding engine where the success of EchoDNS directly fuels the growth of Echo Universe. It is ambitious, but with disciplined execution, it is achievable.
