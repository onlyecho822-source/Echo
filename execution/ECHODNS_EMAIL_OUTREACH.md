## The 3-Email Sequence

This sequence is designed to be direct, respectful of their time, and laser-focused on solving a real, quantifiable pain point.

### Email 1: The 15-Hour Problem (Send Day 1)

**Subject:** Save 15 hours/week on DNS management?

**Body:**

Hi [Contact Name],

My name is Nathan Poinsette, founder of EchoDNS.

I’m reaching out because we’ve developed a tool that helps MSPs like [Company Name] save over 15 hours per week by automating bulk DNS record management across multiple registrars like GoDaddy and Namecheap.

Our system bypasses API rate limits and allows your team to update 100+ domains in a single batch, eliminating the tedious, manual work that currently consumes your senior engineers’ time.

I can show you how it works in a 10-minute live demo next week.

Would you be open to that?

Best,

Nathan Poinsette
Founder, EchoDNS

### Email 2: The Follow-Up (Send Day 2)

**Subject:** Re: Save 15 hours/week on DNS management?

**Body:**

Hi [Contact Name],

Just following up on my email from yesterday. The average MSP we speak with is losing over $75,000 per year in billable hours tied up in manual DNS updates.

EchoDNS gives that time back to you.

Here’s a quick link to my calendar if you’d like to book a 10-minute demo: [Link to your Calendly/scheduling tool]

Best,

Nathan

### Email 3: The Final Touch (Send Day 3)

**Subject:** Final follow-up

**Body:**

Hi [Contact Name],

I understand you’re busy. I won’t follow up again after this.

If you’re still struggling with the time sink of managing DNS records for your clients, our tool can solve that problem within the week. If not, I wish you all the best.

Best,

Nathan

## Execution Plan

1.  **Personalize Each Email:** Before sending, do a quick search on the company and contact. Mention a recent company achievement or a shared connection if possible. This small step increases response rates by over 50%.

2.  **Use an Email Sending Tool:** Use a tool like [Reply.io](https://reply.io/) or [Mailshake](https://mailshake.com/) to automate the sequence. This ensures follow-ups are sent on time without manual effort.

3.  **Track Opens and Clicks:** Monitor who is engaging with your emails. If someone opens Email 1 multiple times but doesn’t reply, they are a high-priority follow-up.

4.  **Be Ready for Responses:** Have your demo script and scheduling link ready. The goal is to move them from email to a live conversation as quickly as possible.

This sequence is designed for maximum impact with minimum noise. It respects the recipient’s time while clearly communicating the value you offer. Execute this, and you will get demos.
